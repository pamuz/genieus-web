/* 
 * This is the routes file. It exports an array of objects, each 
 * of which contains properties that describe a route. For each
 * of the objects in the routes array the `body` property is of
 * particular importance, it is a function that returns the class
 * of a React.Component, the component returned by that function
 * will be the one rendered when the browser is on that route.
 * 
 * For more information of what the elements do visit the
